    "The Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problem consists in determining whether a Boolean formula is satisfiable or not. This problem is one of the most widely studied combinatorial problems in computer science. It is the classic NP-complete problem. Over the past number of decades, a significant amount of research work has focused on solving SAT problems with both complete and incomplete solvers.\n",
    "\n",
    "An extended version of the problem is Model Counting (#SAT). In #SAT the solver needs to compute the number of solutions of a Boolean formula. A wide variety of solvers have been designed to tackle this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we want to create an Algorithm Selection (AS) approach to Model Counting. For each #SAT instance, there is a specific solver that works better than the others, the goal of your machine learing approach is to classify it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In AS we represent #SAT problems with a vector of 72 features with general information about the problem, e.g., number of variables, number of clauses, etc. There is no need to understand the features to be able to complete the assignment. For each instance, there is a 'label' column representing the name of the optimal solver."

    "# Task 2 - Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### GridSearchCV was performed on a pipeline wherein Scaling (either MinMaxScaler or StandardScaler) along with Feature Selection (SelectPercentile) and Dimensional Reduction technique (PCA) was used either separately or in tandem prior to the K-Nearest Neighbours model. So, the pipeline had either 3 or 4 components in it, and hyperparameterisation was performed for all components except scaling, as only the type of scaling was switched across pipelines. The overall pipeline was fit and evaluated on 5-fold Cross Validation.\n",
    "#### 1) Pipeline with different scalers switched but with only PCA applied yielded a maximum of 69.8% validation accuracy. (Best one - MinMaxScaler, 4 components of PCA and 7 neighbours in KNN)\n",
    "#### 2) Next, pipeline was fit with both PCA and SelectPercentile where SelectPercentile performed ANOVA test between each input column with the output column to select the columns in the top 20 percentile of scores. Here the validation accuracy improved but was limited to 71.32%.\n",
    "#### 3) Finally, the best results were obtained when the cross validation was performed on pipeline with MinMaxScaling, SelectPercentile and KNN model (No PCA in this model) with parameters KNN Neighbours - 11 and 20% of the top features were chosen by SelectPercentile (15 features) method. Final and best validation accuracy achieved with this method - 73.81%"

    "#### 3) Although highest training accuracy (77.2%) was achieved by LightGBM Classifier on it's best set of parameters found out by hyperparameter tuning on GridSearchCV, highest validation accuracy  of 77.8% was achieved by CatBoost Classifier on it's own best set of parameters with a very marginal difference between the train accuracy between the two models. Catboost train accuracy - 76.04%\n",
